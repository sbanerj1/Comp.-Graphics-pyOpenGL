Steps to run Orrery.py:-

1. Open cmd (command prompt) script
2. Go to the directory location (cd .../Sandipan_Banerjee_Assignment2)
3. Type 'python Orrery.py' and press Enter
4. Orrery window should open up with Sun (center), Mercury, Venus, Earth and Moon
5. Press '+' to increase days per frame
6. Press '-' to decrease days per frame (but always > 0)
7. Click inside the Sun to toggle the fill orientation of the bodies (solid to non-solid and vice versa)
8. Press 'q' or 'Q' to quit and close window



P.S. I was unable to implement the other functionalities in Python due to my impaired knowledge (and understanding) of OpenGL and GLSL. 
Hence, I am really apprehensive about the outcome of this course.
