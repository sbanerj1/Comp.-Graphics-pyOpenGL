Steps to run Assignment7WithBonus.py:-

1. Open cmd (command prompt) script
2. Go to the directory location (cd .../SandipanBanerjee_Assignment7)
3. Type 'python Assignment7WithBonus.py' and press Enter
4. The reflecting/mapping sphere should appear at the centre with a scene around it
5. A car model (mesh), a pillow model and an animated wall should appear as well around the sphere
6. A particle system with 100 particles should appear as well (Bonus) 
7. The particles should start from a centre point, move with a varying velocity, and uniform shrinking radius (Bonus)
8. The particles should also change direction if they get too close to the boundary of the window (Bonus)
9. They should reappear from a different centre point with different color once they disappear (Bonus)
10. There should be a point light (white) and a spot light (green) with a 90 degree circle projecting inwards 
11. The back wall should have an animation with the image texture zooming in and out 
12. Hold the left click button and drag the mouse around to change the perspective of the reflecting sphere
13. Hit 'a' or 'A' to zoom in to the whole scene (increase reflecting sphere radius)
14. Hit 'd' or 'D' to zoom out of the whole scene (increase reflecting sphere radius)
15. Hit 'i' or 'I' to zoom in car
16. Hit 'o' or 'O' to zoom out car
17. Hit 'w' or 'W' to zoom in pillow
18. Hit 'x' or 'X' to zoom out pillow
19. Hit 's' or 'S' to turn the spot light source on/off
20. Hit 'p' or 'P' to turn the point light source on/off
21. Hit 'f' or 'F' to save current frame into .png file
22. Hit 'r' or 'R' to rotate the car in anti clockwise direction
23. Hit 't' or 'T' to rotate the pillow in anti clockwise direction
24. Press 'b' or 'B' to toggle between drawing particle system on/off (Bonus)
25. Hit 'q' or 'Q' key to quit.


Notes :- 

1. I am using "pygame', an alternative window creating library to Glut, for this program as that was the
only available python example working that I found online for cube mapping. If you have any problem running, 
or a missing file, with pygame, please let me know.

2. I am using the same mesh models, objects and the code that I used for assignment 5, as per the suggestion
on the course webpage.

3. Some exceptions/warnings are shown when the window is closed. I don't know why they appear, but they are
not causing any problem as far as I know.


I hope the code works properly and is at least close to what was expected. Happy Thanksgiving!!!
